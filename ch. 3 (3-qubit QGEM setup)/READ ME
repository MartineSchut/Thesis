These codes have been use for chapter 3, which has been published in Phys. Rev. A 105 (2022) no.3, 032411

The simulation code has been developed for "Qudits for witnessing quantum-gravity-induced entanglement of masses under decoherence" (Phys. Rev. A 104 (2021) no.5, 052416) by Jules Tilly and modified slightly to fit the three-qubit setup.
